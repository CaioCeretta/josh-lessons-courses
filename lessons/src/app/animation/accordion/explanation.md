In the accordion types, we can pass four different values, which are



In the context of using framer-motion with the Accordion component, the transition prop accepts an object that can include various properties, depending on the type of animation you want to apply. Since you’re using the spring type, here are some common properties you can use:

and in each type of accordion we can also add the variant expanded and collapsed, which are the different visual states of a component

Variants: Define the different visual states of a component (like expanded and collapsed).
Transitions: Control how the component animates between these states.



spring.

stiffness: Controls the rigidity of the spring. Higher values make the spring more rigid and result in a quicker animation.
damping: Controls how much the spring resists motion. Lower values make the spring bouncier, while higher values make it settle faster.
mass: Controls the weight of the object being animated. Higher values make the spring slower.
delay: Specifies a delay before the transition starts.
duration: The duration of the transition.
An example with all properties

transition={{
  type: 'spring',
  stiffness: 120,
  damping: 20,
  mass: 1,
  delay: 0,
  bounce: 0.25
}}

tween:

A basic interpolation over time, typically used for non-physical transitions.
Common properties:
duration: The length of the animation in seconds.

ease: The easing function, such as 'linear', 'easeIn', 'easeOut', 'easeInOut', or custom easing arrays.
delay: A delay before the transition starts.

transition={{
  type: 'tween',
  duration: 0.5,
  ease: 'easeInOut',
  delay: 0.1
}}
keyframes:

Used to create animations that progress through multiple keyframes. You define a sequence of values, and the animation will move through each one.

Common properties:

values: An array of values that the animation will progress through.
times: An array of time values (fractions) that correspond to when each value should be reached.
duration: Total duration of the animation.
ease: Easing function for each segment.

transition={{
  type: 'keyframes',
  values: [0, 1, 0.5, 1],
  times: [0, 0.25, 0.75, 1],
  duration: 2
}}



inertia:

Simulates motion with a realistic deceleration, often used when you want an element to slide and gradually come to a stop.
Common properties:
velocity: The initial velocity of the movement.
power: Controls the intensity of the movement.
timeConstant: How quickly the movement slows down.
bounceStiffness: How stiff the bounce effect is (if any).
bounceDamping: How dampened the bounce effect is.

transition={{
  type: 'inertia',
  velocity: 200,
  power: 0.8,
  timeConstant: 750,
  bounceStiffness: 100,
  bounceDamping: 10
}}


just:
A simple, instantaneous transition with no animation, used when you want to switch to a value immediately.
Common properties: This type doesn’t have specific properties because the transition happens immediately.

These different types of transitions give you flexibility in creating various animation effects based on the desired behavior and interaction.
