# Dialogs Animation

## What are dialogs

Dialogs are UI components that display content in a layer above the main application interface, often used to capture user
input, confirm actions, or provide information. They temporarily interrupt the userâ€™s workflow to focus attention on a specific task or message.

Key characteristics of dialogs include:

Overlay: Dialogs typically appear with a semi-transparent background overlay to draw focus away from the main content and toward the dialog itself.
Interaction: Users interact with dialogs to perform tasks such as filling out forms, making selections, or confirming actions.
Modal vs. Non-modal:
Modal Dialogs: Require the user to interact with them before returning to the main application (e.g., a confirmation dialog).
Non-modal Dialogs: Allow the user to interact with other parts of the application while the dialog remains open (e.g., a chat window).
Close Mechanism: Dialogs usually include buttons or options to close them, and many also support closing by clicking outside of the dialog area or pressing the escape key.
Dialogs are essential for guiding users through tasks that need their full attention or for displaying important information that should not be missed.


## Dialog useClickOutsideHook

Dialogs with Click Outside Detection:

These dialogs are interactive UI elements that often need to close or trigger specific actions when the user clicks or touches outside of them. To achieve this:

Click Outside Detection: The dialog component uses a custom hook (useClickOutside) to monitor click or touch events on the entire document.
Inside vs. Outside Clicks: The hook checks whether the event occurred inside the dialog. If the click or touch happens inside, nothing happens, allowing the user to interact with the dialog without closing it accidentally. If the event occurs outside the dialog, a designated callback function is triggered, typically closing the dialog or executing another action.
This approach ensures that the dialog remains open while the user interacts with it but closes gracefully when they click elsewhere, improving the overall user experience.


### Dialog Basics One

To present the dialog to be expanded have a dialog animation, the dialog animation consists of a DialogTrigger, which
will cause the modal to open, in this case, the dialog trigger is a desk lamp, and below it we have a div with a title,
subtitle, and a button where we tell the user to click to see more.
On button click, we will have the expanded dialog, where we are going to have all the informations, such as the description
and the dialog content. The dialog description component may receive a boolean of disableLayoutAnimation, that would hide
the miniature of the trigger dialog. And a property of the variants that we want to include on that description, variants like
initial, animate, exit.
Then we are going to have a Dialog container which is going to wrap the Dialog content. Inside of it, we are going to have
an image, a title, subtitle and a description that consists of a set of p tags where we would fill that description like
we would do normally and below the description we will have a DialogClose

## Dialog Basics Two

In this Dialog we have a similar structure, on the transition we have a difference, our dialog transition consisted of
a type string, bounce and duration, duration is the time the animation takes to finish, and the bounce is the same as a 
spring effect when it reaches the bottom. On this other example, we have also the type of string, but now we have the stiffnes
and damping

Transition Effects

Stiffness
What it does: Controls how stiff the spring is. A higher stiffness means the spring is stronger, making the animation move
faster and more rigidly towards its target.

Effect: Increasing the stiffness value will result in a quicker, more forceful animation. Conversely, lowering the stiffness
will make the animation slower and more fluid. 

Damping
What it does: Controls how much the spring resists oscillation (bouncing). Higher damping means the spring will come to
rest more quickly with less oscillation.

Effect: Increasing the damping value will reduce the amount of bounce, making the animation settle faster. Lowering the
damping will make the animation bounce more before coming to rest. The other difference is that this is a full row at the top
but that is common behavior of the parent element, in the first example we had a fixed width around everything


## Dialog Basics Image

The dialog basic image is an example of a click expanding the image of the dialog, it's just a dialog with the transition of
ease: 'easeInOut', which will cause the animation to be smooth, fast in the beginning and slow at the end. the image would
be in a smaller size, then on clikc it would expand the dialog which would only have on itws content the DialogImage
with the classes of the width and the height, and a dialog close
