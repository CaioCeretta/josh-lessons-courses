# Carousel Basics

The carousel is pretty straight forward, we have inside the carousel, a carousel content, and inside each one of those we
have a set of items where we will style each item. @e also included the <CarouselNavigation /> component
we can apply at the end of the carousel, it will make the arrows on the far sides to appear and control the slides

## Carousel Custom Sizes
Then we have a carousel with , in the example we used, we passed a basis of 1/3, where we will set the style as
basis-1/3, where each item will have 1/3 of the container, we also included the <CarouselNavigation /> component
we can apply at the end of the carousel, it will make the arrows on the far sides to appear and control the slides

## Carousel Spacing

This example is very similar to the above, the difference is that it now has a spacing between the items, and we styled
the navigation buttons, placing them below the slides, and we have two different properties inside the CarouselNavigation
we have the classNames, where we will place styling for the position, size of the button, spacing, etc, and we also have the
classNameButton, where we will style inside the buttons
